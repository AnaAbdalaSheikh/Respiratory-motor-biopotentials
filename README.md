# Respiratory-motor-biopotentials
This repository contains an algorithm for analysis of biopotentials recorded from nerves that drive respiratory muscles.
The script was created to work with Spike2 8.16 x64 Unicode (Apr 26 2019 14:14:41).
The algorithm analyses several features of integrated waveforms from phrenic, central vagus, recurrent laryngeal, hypoglossal, iliohypogastric nerves, and/or lumbar sympathetic trunk
The script was created for personal use so it does not contain instructions.
For help using the script please contact ana.abdala@bristol.ac.uk.
You must acknowledge the author, Dr Ana Abdala Sheikh, in all scientific outputs that arise from direct use of this script.
